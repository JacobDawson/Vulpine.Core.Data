# Vulpine Core Library: Data Structures

This project is part of the Vulpine Core Library, a repository of code that I 
use for all my personal projects. The projects that comprise this library are 
under constant development, and are subject to change at any time. The API is 
not guaranteed to be backwards comparable. I cannot in good faith recommend 
this library for use in production code. There are better, more stable 
libraries out there that do the same thing. You may, however, find it useful
for personal projects and educational purposes. The entire library is 
documented in source, so there shouldn't be any confusion about what something 
dose. I have begun to release parts of this library as open source, in the hope 
that someone will find it useful.

This part of the Vulpine Core Library deals with data structures. It can be 
seen as a replacement for System.Collections.Generic. In includes some new 
features, including new data structures missing from the system library. It 
also focuses more on implementation, allowing the user to select the best 
implementation for the current job. It also contains a few additional classes 
which pertain to data structures, and are used throughout the rest of the 
library.
